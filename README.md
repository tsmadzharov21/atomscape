## Game Overview

In AtomScape, players control a molecule that needs to consume atoms for survival. However, watch out for the pesky viruses that are trying to catch and destroy your molecule! Navigate through the game world, strategize your moves, and see how many atoms your molecule can devour before falling victim to the viruses.

## Features

ðŸŒŒ **Dynamic Gameplay:** Experience a fast-paced and dynamic gaming environment with constantly changing challenges.

ðŸ§¬ **Molecular Strategy:** Plan your moves strategically to avoid viruses and capture atoms efficiently.

ðŸŽ‰ **Power-ups:** Collect power-ups to enhance your molecule's abilities or gain temporary advantages.

ðŸš€ **Levels:** Progress through increasingly difficult levels, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:**
   - Use arrow keys or WASD to navigate your molecule.
